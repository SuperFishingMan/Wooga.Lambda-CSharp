Introduction
-------

Wooga.Lambda is a set of functional utilities & primitives for C# which are inspired by [csharp-monads](https://github.com/louthy/csharp-monad), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) & [F#](http://fsharp.org).
Furthermore they are 100% compatible with Unity3D.

Samples & documentation
-----------------------

The library comes with comprehensible documentation and includes several tutorials.

 * [Have a look at the Maybe tutorial to get started](wooga.lambda.maybe.html)

 * [Check out these Presentation Slides](presentation_04_2015/index.html)

 * [Check out the API Reference](reference/index.html)
