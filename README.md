## Functional primitives for Unity3D

*Unity3D* being so far behind the *.NET* and *Mono* world,
this library is an attempt at backporting some features found in more
recent runtimes and *C# libraries* as well as pick up and harness useful
ideas and patterns from other languages and/or programming paradigms.....


Samples & documentation
-----------------------

The library comes with ~~comprehensible~~ documentation and includes ~~several~~ tutorials.

 * [Have a look at the **Maybe** tutorial to get started](wooga.lambda.maybe.html)

 * [If you know that already, how about **Either**?](wooga.lambda.either.html)

 * [Have a peek at a rather small slide deck](presentation_04_2015/index.html)

 * [Check out the API Reference](reference/index.html)
